### Sobre Palestra
Artificial Creativity in music composition has been a topic of debate among scholars, artists, and computing experts. What's not controversial is that writing code to generate music is a ton of fun, especially with tools like Magenta that make it easier for developers to process music data without being experts on neural networks.

In this talk we will walk through how to create music with Magenta using a recurrent neural network trained on the soundtracks from classic Nintendo Entertainment System games. We will then live-code a Python web application which uses the Twilio API to provide a phone number people can call to listen to newly-generated music in the style of old Nintendo games in real time.



### Minibio
Sam Agnew is a developer evangelist at Twilio and loves showing developers around the world the joys of creative coding. He particularly enjoys being a member of the Python and JavaScript communities in New York City. The only thing he finds more satisfying than writing code is playing fast guitar solos and hacking old video games.
